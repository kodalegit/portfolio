      <p>
        I am passionate about solving problems in an elegant and performant way.
        I started out designing and building physical solutions as a civil
        engineer then transitioned into the limitless digital world where I'm

        </a>
        , a platform that enables creators to cryptographically sign their
        images and verify provenance information. I am open to opportunities
        that can enable me to grow, innovate and challenge the bounds of what is
        thought to be possible.
